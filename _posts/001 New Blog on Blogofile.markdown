It seems it has been a long long time since I last blogged actively. My last active blog is in Blogger called [dev-test-ops](http://developer-in-test.blogspot.com). But since I moved to China accessing blogger is a pain. So I always wanted to find a better palce to move my blog.
After trying wordpress unsuccessfully, here I am blogging in uber geek style :).

###A bit about me for who are new###
I am Sai Venkat. I work as a programmer in a consulting firm, Thoughtworks. As I am not a big fan of consulting, I sit alone and find ways to make systems perform better & scalable which is one of my speciality. I am a sucker for any concurrency & multicore problems, concurrent algorithms & data structures. I believe Concurrency is one of those areas where theory meets practice & frontiers where research meets practice & such areas fascinates me.

My recent area of interest and research is Software Transactional Memory. Here is the implementation I have been contributing to [Multiverse](http://multiverse.codehaus.org). I am interested in working on Concurrency problems on JVM but not preferrably Java :).
I specialize in databases as well mostly in their concurrency & scaling models. Most of this blog will either be filled with Transactional Memoy materials or something concerened with Concurrency.

###About this site###
This is my pensieve. The site acts as my way to share what I think & want to remember. It is built with python, blogofile, git & github. I didn't want to use jekyll because I didn't want both ruby & python in the same machine :P. 

### That's it! ###
Thank you for showing interesting in the site. I am sure you will find the coming posts interesting & sometimes controversial...

### Credits ###
I am too lazy to build the blog myself.. So I got this blog from [here](http://manuel-ohlendorf.de/blog/2010/12/23/hosting-a-blogofile-blog-on-github-with-github-pages/). Thanks Manuel for great work.
