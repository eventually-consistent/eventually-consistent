      <description>New Blog on Blogfile and Github</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="p1">It seems it has been a long long time since I last blogged actively. My last active blog is in Blogger called <a href="http://developer-in-test.blogspot.com">dev-test-ops</a>. But since I moved to China accessing blogger is a pain. So I always wanted to find a better palce to move my blog.
After trying wordpress unsuccessfully, here I am blogging in uber geek style :).</p>
<h3>A bit about me for those who are new</h3>
<p id="p2">I am Sai Venkat. I work as a Devops and developer-in-test in a consulting firm, Thoughtworks. Automated continuous deployments, large scale infrastructure management and finding ways to make systems perform better &amp; scalable are my specialities. I love working on any concurrency &amp; multicore problems, concurrent algorithms &amp; data structures. I believe Concurrency is one of those areas where theory meets practice &amp; a frontier where research meets practice &amp; such areas fascinates me.</p>
<p id="p3">My recent area of interest and research is Software Transactional Memory. Here is the implementation I have been contributing to <a href="http://multiverse.codehaus.org">Multiverse</a>. Currently I am working on Transactional Collections like Transactional LinkedLists, HashMaps &amp; SkipLists. I am interested in working on Concurrency problems on JVM but not preferrably Java :). I specialize in databases as well mostly in their concurrency &amp; scaling models. Most of this blog will either be filled with Transactional Memoy materials or something concerened with Concurrency.</p>
<h3>About this site</h3>
<p id="p4">This is my pensieve. The site acts as my way to share what I think &amp; want to remember. It is built with python, blogofile, git &amp; github. I didn't want to use jekyll because I didn't want both ruby &amp; python in the same machine :P. </p>
<h3>That's it!</h3>
<p id="p5">Thank you for showing interesting in the site. I am sure you will find the coming posts interesting &amp; sometimes controversial...</p>
<h3>Credits</h3>
<p id="p6">I am too lazy to build the blog myself.. So I got this blog from <a href="http://manuel-ohlendorf.de/blog/2010/12/23/hosting-a-blogofile-blog-on-github-with-github-pages/">here</a>. Thanks Manuel for great work.</p>]]></content:encoded>
